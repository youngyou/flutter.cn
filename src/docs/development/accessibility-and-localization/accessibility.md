description: Information on Flutter's accessibility support.
---

Flutter is committed to supporting developers who want to make their apps more
accessible: usable by as many people as possible, including those with
disabilities such as blindness or motor impairment.

Flutter supports three components for accessibility support:

* **[Large fonts](#large-fonts)**: Render text widgets with user-specified font
  sizes
* **[Screen readers](#screen-readers)**: Communicate spoken feedback about UI
  contents
* **[Sufficient contrast](#sufficient-contrast)**: Render widgets with colors
  that have sufficient contrast

## Inspecting Accessibility support

Details of these are discussed below. In addition to testing for these
specific topics, we recommend using automated accessibility scanners:

  * For Android:
    1. Install the [Accessibility Scanner][] for Android
    1. Enable the Accessibility Scanner from **Android Settings > Accessibility >
       Accessibility Scanner > On**
    1. Navigate to the Accessibility Scanner 'checkbox' icon button to initiate a
       scan

  * For iOS:
    1. Open the `iOS` folder of your Flutter app in Xcode
    1. Select a Simulator as the target, and click **Run** button
    1. In Xcode, select **Xcode > Open Developer Tools > Accessibility Inspector**
    1. In the Accessibility Inspector, select **Inspection > Enable Point to
       Inspect**, and then select the various user interface elements in running
       Flutter app to inspect their accessibility attributes
    1. In the Accessibility Inspector, select **Audit** in the toolbar, and then
       select **Run Audio** to get a report of potential issues

## Large fonts

Both Android and iOS contain system settings to configure the desired font
sizes used by apps. Flutter text widgets respect this OS setting when
determining font sizes.

### Tips for developers

Font sizes are calculated automatically by Flutter based on the OS setting.
However, as a developer you should make sure your layout has enough room to
render all its contents when the font sizes are increased. For example you can
test all parts of your app on a small-screen device configured to use the
largest font setting.

### Example

The following two screenshots show the standard Flutter app template rendered
with the default iOS font setting, and with the largest font setting selected in
iOS accessibility settings.

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    {% include app-figure.md image="a18n/app-regular-fonts.png" caption="Default font setting" img-class="border" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    {% include app-figure.md image="a18n/app-large-fonts.png" caption="Largest accessibility font setting" img-class="border" %}
  </div>
</div>

## Screen readers

Screen readers ([TalkBack][], [VoiceOver][]) enable visually
impaired users to get spoken feedback about the contents of the screen.

### Tips for developers

Turn on VoiceOver or TalkBack on your device and navigate around your app. If
you run into any issues, use the [Semantics widget][] to customize the
accessibility experience of your app.

## Sufficient contrast

Sufficient color contrast makes text and images easier to read. Along with
benefitting users with various visual impairments, sufficient color contrast
helps all users when viewing an interface on devices in extreme lighting
conditions, such as when exposed to direct sunlight or on a display with low
brightness.

The [W3C recommends][]:

* At least 4.5:1 for small text (below 18 point regular or 14 point bold)
* At least 3.0:1 for large text (18 point and above regular or 14 point and
  above bold)

### Tips for developers

Make sure any images you include have sufficient contrast.

When specifying colors on widgets, make sure sufficient contrast is used between
foreground and background color selections.
