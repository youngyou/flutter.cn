The animation system in Flutter is based on typed
[`Animation`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Animation-class.html)
objects. Widgets can either incorporate these animations in their build
functions directly by reading their current value and listening to their
state changes or they can use the animations as the basis of more elaborate
animations that they pass along to other widgets.

## Animation

The primary building block of the animation system is the
[`Animation`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Animation-class.html)
class.  An animation represents a value of a specific type that can change
over the lifetime of the animation. Most widgets that perform an animation
receive an `Animation` object as a parameter, from which they read the current
value of the animation and to which they listen for changes to that value.

### `addListener`

Whenever the animation's value changes, the animation notifies all the
listeners added with
[`addListener`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Animation/addListener.html).
Typically, a [`State`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/State-class.html)
object that listens to an animation will call
[`setState`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/State/setState.html) on
itself in its listener callback to notify the widget system that it needs to
rebuild with the new value of the animation.

This pattern is so common that there are two widgets that help widgets rebuild
when animations change value:
[`AnimatedWidget`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/AnimatedWidget-class.html)
and
[`AnimatedBuilder`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/AnimatedBuilder-class.html).
The first, `AnimatedWidget`, is most useful for stateless animated widgets.
To use `AnimatedWidget`, simply subclass it and implement the
[`build`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/AnimatedWidget/build.html)
function. The second, `AnimatedBuilder`, is useful for more complex widgets
that wish to include an animation as part of a larger build function. To use
`AnimatedBuilder`, simply construct the widget and pass it a `builder` function.

### `addStatusListener`

Animations also provide an
[`AnimationStatus`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/AnimationStatus-class.html),
which indicates how the animation will evolve over time. Whenever the animation's
status changes, the animation notifies all the listeners added with
[`addStatusListener`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Animation/addStatusListener.html).
Typically, animations start out in the `dismissed` status, which means they're
at the beginning of their range. For example, animations that progress from 0.0
to 1.0 will be `dismissed` when their value is 0.0. An animation might then run
`forward` (e.g., from 0.0 to 1.0) or perhaps in `reverse` (e.g., from 1.0 to
0.0). Eventually, if the animation reaches the end of its range (e.g., 1.0), the
animation reaches the `completed` status.

## Animation&shy;Controller

To create an animation, first create an
[`AnimationController`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html).
As well as being an animation itself, an `AnimationController` lets you control
the animation. For example, you can tell the controller to play the animation
[`forward`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/AnimationController/forward.html)
or [`stop`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/AnimationController/stop.html)
the animation. You can also [`fling`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/AnimationController/fling.html)
animations, which uses a physical simulation, such as a spring, to drive the
animation.

Once you've created an animation controller, you can start building other
animations based on it. For example, you can create a
[`ReverseAnimation`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/ReverseAnimation-class.html)
that mirrors the original animation but runs in the opposite direction (e.g.,
from 1.0 to 0.0). Similarly, you can create a
[`CurvedAnimation`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/CurvedAnimation-class.html)
whose value is adjusted by a [curve]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Curves-class.html).

## Tweens

To animate beyond the 0.0 to 1.0 interval, you can use a
[`Tween<T>`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Tween-class.html), which
interpolates between its
[`begin`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Tween/begin.html)
and [`end`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Tween/end.html)
values. Many types have specific `Tween` subclasses that provide type-specific
interpolation. For example,
[`ColorTween`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/ColorTween-class.html)
interpolates between colors and
[`RectTween`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/RectTween-class.html)
interpolates between rects. You can define your own interpolations by creating
your own subclass of `Tween` and overriding its
[`lerp`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Tween/lerp.html)
function.

By itself, a tween just defines how to interpolate between two values. To get
a concrete value for the current frame of an animation, you also need an
animation to determine the current state. There are two ways to combine a tween
with an animation to get a concrete value:

1. You can [`evaluate`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Animatable/evaluate.html)
   the tween at the current value of an animation. This approach is most useful
   for widgets that are already listening to the animation and hence
   rebuilding whenever the animation changes value.

2. You can [`animate`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Animatable/animate.html)
   the tween based on the animation. Rather than returning a single value, the
   animate function returns a new `Animation` that incorporates the tween. This
   approach is most useful when you want to give the newly created animation to
   another widget, which can then read the current value that incorporates
   the tween as well as listen for changes to the value.

## Architecture

Animations are actually built from a number of core building blocks.

### Scheduler

The
[`SchedulerBinding`]({{site.api}}/flutter/scheduler/SchedulerBinding-mixin.html)
is a singleton class that exposes the Flutter scheduling primitives.

For this discussion, the key primitive is the frame callbacks. Each
time a frame needs to be shown on the screen, Flutter's engine
triggers a "begin frame" callback which the scheduler multiplexes to
all the listeners registered using
[`scheduleFrameCallback()`]({{site.api}}/flutter/scheduler/SchedulerBinding/scheduleFrameCallback.html).
All these callbacks are given the official time stamp of the frame, in
the form of a `Duration` from some arbitrary epoch. Since all the
callbacks have the same time, any animations triggered from these
callbacks will appear to be exactly synchronised even if they take a
few milliseconds to be executed.

### Tickers

The
[`Ticker`]({{site.api}}/flutter/scheduler/Ticker-class.html)
class hooks into the scheduler's
[`scheduleFrameCallback()`]({{site.api}}/flutter/scheduler/SchedulerBinding/scheduleFrameCallback.html)
mechanism to invoke a callback every tick.

A `Ticker` can be started and stopped. When started, it returns a
`Future` that will resolve when it is stopped.

Each tick, the `Ticker` provides the callback with the duration since
the first tick after it was started.

Because tickers always give their elapsed time relative to the first
tick after they were started, tickers are all synchronised. If you
start three ticks at different times between two frames, they will all
nonetheless be synchronised with the same starting time, and will
subsequently tick in lockstep.

### Simulations

The
[`Simulation`]({{site.api}}/flutter/physics/Simulation-class.html)
abstract class maps a relative time value (an elapsed time) to a
double value, and has a notion of completion.

In principle simulations are stateless but in practice some simulations
(for example,
[`BouncingScrollSimulation`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/BouncingScrollSimulation-class.html) and
[`ClampingScrollSimulation`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/ClampingScrollSimulation-class.html))
change state irreversibly when queried.

There are [various concrete implementations]({{site.api}}/flutter/physics/physics-library.html)
of the `Simulation` class for different effects.

### Animatables

The
[`Animatable`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Animatable-class.html)
abstract class maps a double to a value of a particular type.

`Animatable` classes are stateless and immutable.

#### Tweens

The
[`Tween`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Tween-class.html)
abstract class maps a double value nominally in the range 0.0-1.0 to a
typed value (e.g. a `Color`, or another double). It is an
`Animatable`.

It has a notion of an output type (`T`), a `begin` value and an `end`
value of that type, and a way to interpolate (`lerp`) between the
begin and end values for a given input value (the double nominally in
the range 0.0-1.0).

`Tween` classes are stateless and immutable.

#### Composing animatables

Passing an `Animatable<double>` (the parent) to an `Animatable`'s
`chain()` method creates a new `Animatable` subclass that applies the
parent's mapping then the child's mapping.

### Curves

The
[`Curve`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Curve-class.html)
abstract class maps doubles nominally in the range 0.0-1.0 to doubles
nominally in the range 0.0-1.0.

`Curve` classes are stateless and immutable.

### Animations

The
[`Animation`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/Animation-class.html)
abstract class provides a value of a given type, a concept of
animation direction and animation status, and a listener interface to
register callbacks that get invoked when the value or status change.

Some subclasses of `Animation` have values that never change
([`kAlwaysCompleteAnimation`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/kAlwaysCompleteAnimation-constant.html),
[`kAlwaysDismissedAnimation`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/kAlwaysDismissedAnimation-constant.html),
[`AlwaysStoppedAnimation`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/AlwaysStoppedAnimation-class.html));
registering callbacks on these has no effect as the callbacks are
never called.

The `Animation<double>` variant is special because it can be used to
represent a double nominally in the range 0.0-1.0, which is the input
expected by `Curve` and `Tween` classes, as well as some further
subclasses of `Animation`.

Some `Animation` subclasses are stateless, merely forwarding listeners
to their parents. Some are very stateful.

#### Composable animations

Most `Animation` subclasses take an explicit "parent"
`Animation<double>`. They are driven by that parent.

The `CurvedAnimation` subclass takes an `Animation<double>` class (the
parent) and a couple of `Curve` classes (the forward and reverse
curves) as input, and uses the value of the parent as input to the
curves to determine its output. `CurvedAnimation` is immutable and
stateless.

The `ReverseAnimation` subclass takes an `Animation<double>` class as
its parent and reverses all the values of the animation. It assumes
the parent is using a value nominally in the range 0.0-1.0 and returns
a value in the range 1.0-0.0. The status and direction of the parent
animation are also reversed. `ReverseAnimation` is immutable and
stateless.

The `ProxyAnimation` subclass takes an `Animation<double>` class as
its parent and merely forwards the current state of that parent.
However, the parent is mutable.

The `TrainHoppingAnimation` subclass takes two parents, and switches
between them when their values cross.

#### Animation Controllers

The
[`AnimationController`]({{site.api}}/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html)
is a stateful `Animation<double>` that uses a `Ticker` to give itself
life. It can be started and stopped. Each tick, it takes the time
elapsed since it was started and passes it to a `Simulation` to obtain
a value. That is then the value it reports. If the `Simulation`
reports that at that time it has ended, then the controller stops
itself.

The animation controller can be given a lower and upper bound to
animate between, and a duration.

In the simple case (using `forward()`, `reverse()`, `play()`, or
`resume()`), the animation controller simply does a linear
interpolation from the lower bound to the upper bound (or vice versa,
for the reverse direction) over the given duration.

When using `repeat()`, the animation controller uses a linear
interpolation between the given bounds over the given duration, but
does not stop.

When using `animateTo()`, the animation controller does a linear
interpolation over the given duration from the current value to the
given target. If no duration is given to the method, the default
duration of the controller and the range described by the controller's
lower bound and upper bound is used to determine the velocity of the
animation.

When using `fling()`, a `Force` is used to create a specific
simulation which is then used to drive the controller.

When using `animateWith()`, the given simulation is used to drive the
controller.

These methods all return the future that the `Ticker` provides and
which will resolve when the controller next stops or changes
simulation.

#### Attaching animatables to animations

Passing an `Animation<double>` (the new parent) to an `Animatable`'s
`animate()` method creates a new `Animation` subclass that acts like
the `Animatable` but is driven from the given parent.
