  * How to use the fundamental classes from the animation library to add
    animation to a widget.
  * When to use `AnimatedWidget` vs. `AnimatedBuilder`.
{{site.alert.end}}

This tutorial shows you how to build explicit animations in Flutter. After
introducing some of the essential concepts, classes, and methods in the
animation library, it walks you through 5 animation examples. The examples build
on each other, introducing you to different aspects of the animation library.

The Flutter SDK also provides transition animations, such as [FadeTransition][],
[SizeTransition][], and [SlideTransition][]. These simple animations are
triggered by setting a beginning and ending point. They are simpler to implement
than explicit animations, which are described here.

<a name="concepts"></a>
## Essential animation concepts and classes

{{site.alert.secondary}}
  <h4 class="no_toc">What's the point?</h4>

  * [Animation][], a core class in Flutter's animation library,
    interpolates the values used to guide an animation.
  * An `Animation` object knows the current state of an animation (for example,
    whether it's started, stopped, or moving forward or in reverse),
    but doesn't know anything about what appears onscreen.
  * An [AnimationController][] manages the `Animation`.
  * A [CurvedAnimation][] defines progression as a non-linear curve.
  * A [Tween][] interpolates between the range of data as used by the
    object being animated. For example, a `Tween` might define an interpolation
    from red to blue, or from 0 to 255.
  * Use Listeners and StatusListeners to monitor animation state changes.
{{site.alert.end}}

The animation system in Flutter is based on typed [Animation][] objects. Widgets
can either incorporate these animations in their build functions directly by
reading their current value and listening to their state changes or they can use
the animations as the basis of more elaborate animations that they pass along to
other widgets.

<a name="animation-class"></a>
### Animation<wbr>\<double>

In Flutter, an Animation object knows nothing about what is onscreen.
An `Animation` is an abstract class that understands its current value
and its state (completed or dismissed). One of the more commonly used
animation types is `Animation<double>`.

An `Animation` object sequentially generates
interpolated numbers between two values over a certain duration.
The output of an `Animation` object may be linear, a curve, a step function,
or any other mapping you can devise. Depending on how the `Animation` object
is controlled, it could run in reverse, or even switch directions in the
middle.

Animations can also interpolate types other than double, such as
`Animation<Color>` or `Animation<Size>`.

An `Animation` object has state. Its current value is always available
in the `.value` member.

An `Animation` object knows nothing about rendering or `build()` functions.

### Curved&shy;Animation

A [CurvedAnimation][] defines the animation's progress as a non-linear curve.

<?code-excerpt "animate5/lib/main.dart (CurvedAnimation)"?>
```dart
animation = CurvedAnimation(parent: controller, curve: Curves.easeIn);
```

{{site.alert.note}}
  The [Curves][] class defines many commonly used curves, or you can create your
  own. For example:

  <?code-excerpt "animate5/lib/main.dart (ShakeCurve)" plaster="none"?>
  {% prettify dart context="html" %}
  import 'dart:math';

  class ShakeCurve extends Curve {
    @override
    double transform(double t) => sin(t * pi * 2);
  }
  {% endprettify %}
{{site.alert.end}}

`CurvedAnimation` and `AnimationController` (described in the next section)
are both of type `Animation<double>`, so you can pass them interchangeably.
The CurvedAnimation wraps the object it’s modifying&mdash;you
don’t subclass `AnimationController` to implement a curve.

### Animation&shy;Controller

[AnimationController][] is a special `Animation` object that generates a new
value whenever the hardware is ready for a new frame. By default,
an `AnimationController` linearly produces the numbers from 0.0 to 1.0
during a given duration. For example, this code creates an Animation object,
but does not start it running:

<?code-excerpt "animate5/lib/main.dart (AnimationController)"?>
```dart
controller =
    AnimationController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 2), vsync: this);
```

`AnimationController` derives from `Animation<double>`, so it can be used
wherever an `Animation` object is needed. However, the `AnimationController`
has additional methods to control the animation. For example, you start
an animation with the `.forward()` method. The generation of numbers is
tied to the screen refresh, so typically 60 numbers are generated per
second. After each number is generated, each Animation object calls the
attached Listener objects. To create a custom display list for each
child, see [RepaintBoundary][].

When creating an `AnimationController`, you pass it a `vsync` argument. The
presence of `vsync` prevents offscreen animations from consuming unnecessary
resources. You can use your stateful object as the vsync by adding
`SingleTickerProviderStateMixin` to the class definition. You can see an example
of this in [animate1]({{examples}}/animation/animate1/lib/main.dart) on GitHub.

{% comment %}
The `vsync` object ties the ticking of the animation controller to
the visiblity of the widget, so that when the animating widget goes
off-screen, the ticking stops, and when the widget is restored, it
starts again (without stopping the clock, so it's as if it had
been ticking the whole time, but without using the CPU.)
To use your custom State object as the `vsync`, include the
`TickerProviderStateMixin` when defining the custom State class.
{% endcomment -%}

{{site.alert.note}}
  In some cases, a position might exceed the `AnimationController`'s 0.0-1.0
  range. For example, the `fling()` function allows you to provide velocity,
  force, and position (via the Force object). The position can be anything and
  so can be outside of the 0.0 to 1.0 range.

  A `CurvedAnimation` can also exceed the 0.0 to 1.0 range, even if the
  `AnimationController` doesn't. Depending on the curve selected, the output of
  the `CurvedAnimation` can have a wider range than the input. For example,
  elastic curves such as Curves.elasticIn will significantly overshoot or
  undershoot the default range.
{{site.alert.end}}

### Tween

By default, the `AnimationController` object ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. If you need
a different range or a different data type, you can use a [Tween][] to configure
an animation to interpolate to a different range or data type. For example, the
following `Tween` goes from -200.0 to 0.0:

<?code-excerpt "animate5/lib/main.dart (tween)"?>
```dart
tween = Tween<double>(begin: -200, end: 0);
```

A `Tween` is a stateless object that takes only `begin` and `end`. The sole job
of a `Tween` is to define a mapping from an input range to an output range. The
input range is commonly 0.0 to 1.0, but that’s not a requirement.

A `Tween` inherits from `Animatable<T>`, not from `Animation<T>`. An Animatable,
like Animation, doesn't have to output double. For example, `ColorTween`
specifies a progression between two colors.

<?code-excerpt "animate5/lib/main.dart (colorTween)"?>
```dart
colorTween = ColorTween(begin: Colors.transparent, end: Colors.black54);
```

A `Tween` object does not store any state. Instead, it provides the
`evaluate(Animation<double> animation)` method that applies the mapping function
to the current value of the animation. The current value of the `Animation`
object can be found in the `.value` method. The evaluate function also performs
some housekeeping, such as ensuring that begin and end are returned when the
animation values are 0.0 and 1.0, respectively.

#### Tween.animate

To use a `Tween` object, call `animate()` on the `Tween`, passing in the
controller object. For example, the following code generates the
integer values from 0 to 255 over the course of 500 ms.

<?code-excerpt "animate5/lib/main.dart (IntTween)"?>
```dart
AnimationController controller = AnimationController(
    duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500), vsync: this);
Animation<int> alpha = IntTween(begin: 0, end: 255).animate(controller);
```

{{site.alert.note}}
  The `animate()` method returns an [Animation][], not an [Animatable][].
{{site.alert.end}}

The following example shows a controller, a curve, and a `Tween`:

<?code-excerpt "animate5/lib/main.dart (IntTween-curve)"?>
```dart
AnimationController controller = AnimationController(
    duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 500), vsync: this);
final Animation curve =
    CurvedAnimation(parent: controller, curve: Curves.easeOut);
Animation<int> alpha = IntTween(begin: 0, end: 255).animate(curve);
```

### Animation notifications

An [Animation][] object can have `Listener`s and `StatusListener`s,
defined with `addListener()` and `addStatusListener()`.
A `Listener` is called whenever the value of the animation changes.
The most common behavior of a `Listener` is to call `setState()`
to cause a rebuild. A `StatusListener` is called when an animation begins,
ends, moves forward, or moves reverse, as defined by `AnimationStatus`.
The next section has an example of the `addListener()` method,
and [Monitoring the progress of the animation](#monitoring) shows an
example of `addStatusListener()`.

Each section provides a link to the source code for that example.

### Rendering animations

{{site.alert.secondary}}
  <h4 class="no_toc">What's the point?</h4>

  * How to add basic animation to a widget using `addListener()` and
    `setState()`.
  * Every time the Animation generates a new number, the `addListener()`
    function calls `setState()`.
  * How to define an `AnimatedController` with the required `vsync` parameter.
  * Understanding the "`..`" syntax in "`..addListener`", also known as Dart's
    _cascade notation_.
  * To make a class private, start its name with an underscore (`_`).
{{site.alert.end}}

So far you've learned how to generate a sequence of numbers over time. Nothing
has been rendered to the screen. To render with an `Animation` object, store the
`Animation` object as a member of your widget, then use its value to decide how
to draw.

Consider the following app that draws the Flutter logo without animation:

<?code-excerpt "animate0/lib/main.dart"?>
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(LogoApp());

class LogoApp extends StatefulWidget {
  _LogoAppState createState() => _LogoAppState();
}

class _LogoAppState extends State<LogoApp> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Container(
        margin: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 10),
        height: 300,
        width: 300,
        child: FlutterLogo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

**App source:** [animate0]({{examples}}/animation/animate0)

The following shows the same code modified to animate the logo to grow from
nothing to full size. When defining an `AnimationController`, you must pass in a
`vsync` object. The `vsync` parameter is described in the
[AnimationController](#animationcontroller) section.

The changes from the non-animated example are highlighted:

```

**App source:** [animate1]({{examples}}/animation/animate1)

The `addListener()` function calls `setState()`, so every time the `Animation`
generates a new number, the current frame is marked dirty, which forces
`build()` to be called again. In `build()`, the container changes size because
its height and width now use `animation.value` instead of a hardcoded value.
Dispose of the controller when the animation is finished to prevent memory
leaks.

With these few changes, you’ve created your first animation in Flutter!

<aside class="alert alert-success" markdown="1">
  **Dart language tricks:**
  You may not be familiar with Dart's cascade notation&mdash;the two
  dots in `..addListener()`. This syntax means that the `addListener()`
  method is called with the return value from `animate()`.
  Consider the following example:

  <?code-excerpt "animate1/lib/main.dart (addListener)" replace="/animation.*|\.\.addListener/[!$&!]/g"?>
  {% prettify dart context="html" %}
  [!animation = Tween<double>(begin: 0, end: 300).animate(controller)!]
    [!..addListener!](() {
      // ···
    });
  {% endprettify %}

  This code is equivalent to:

  <?code-excerpt "animate1/lib/main.dart (addListener)" replace="/animation.*/$&;/g; /  \./animation/g; /animation.*/[!$&!]/g"?>
  {% prettify dart context="html" %}
  [!animation = Tween<double>(begin: 0, end: 300).animate(controller);!]
  [!animation.addListener(() {!]
      // ···
    });
  {% endprettify %}

</aside>

###  Simplifying with Animated&shy;Widget

{{site.alert.secondary}}
  <h4 class="no_toc">What's the point?</h4>

  * How to use the [AnimatedWidget][] helper class (instead of `addListener()`
    and `setState()`) to create a widget that animates.
  * Use `AnimatedWidget` to create a widget that performs a reusable animation.
    To separate the transition from the widget, use an
    [AnimatedBuilder.](#refactoring-with-animatedbuilder)
  * Examples of `AnimatedWidget`s in the Flutter API: AnimatedBuilder,
    AnimatedModal&shy;Barrier, DecoratedBox&shy;Transition, FadeTransition,
    Positioned&shy;Transition, Relative&shy;Positioned&shy;Transition,
    RotationTransition, ScaleTransition, SizeTransition, SlideTransition.
{{site.alert.end}}

The `AnimatedWidget` base class allows you to separate out the core widget code
from the animation code. `AnimatedWidget` doesn't need to maintain a `State`
object to hold the animation. Add the following `AnimatedLogo` class:

<?code-excerpt path-base="animation/animate2"?>
<?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (AnimatedLogo)" title?>
```dart
class AnimatedLogo extends AnimatedWidget {
  AnimatedLogo({Key key, Animation<double> animation})
      : super(key: key, listenable: animation);

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final Animation<double> animation = listenable;
    return Center(
      child: Container(
        margin: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 10),
        height: animation.value,
        width: animation.value,
        child: FlutterLogo(),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
<?code-excerpt path-base="animation"?>

`AnimatedLogo` uses the current value of the `animation` when drawing itself.

The `LogoApp` still manages the `AnimationController` and the `Tween`, and it
passes the `Animation` object to `AnimatedLogo`:

<a name="monitoring"></a>
### Monitoring the progress of the animation

{{site.alert.secondary}}
  <h4 class="no_toc">What's the point?</h4>

  * Use `addStatusListener()` for notifications of changes to the animation's
    state, such as starting, stopping, or reversing direction.
  * Run an animation in an infinite loop by reversing direction when
    the animation has either completed or returned to its starting state.
{{site.alert.end}}

It’s often helpful to know when an animation changes state, such as finishing,
moving forward, or reversing. You can get notifications for this with
`addStatusListener()`. The following code modifies the previous example so that
it listens for a state change and prints an update. The highlighted line shows
the change:

<?code-excerpt "animate3/lib/main.dart (print state)" plaster="none" replace="/\/\/ (\.\..*)/$1;/g; /\.\..*/[!$&!]/g; /\n  }/$&\n  \/\/ .../g"?>
```dart
class _LogoAppState extends State<LogoApp> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  Animation<double> animation;
  AnimationController controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    controller =
        AnimationController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 2), vsync: this);
    animation = Tween<double>(begin: 0, end: 300).animate(controller)
      [!..addStatusListener((state) => print('$state'));!]
    controller.forward();
  }
  // ...
}
```

Running this code produces this output:

```console
AnimationStatus.forward
AnimationStatus.completed
```
Next, use `addStatusListener()` to reverse the animation at the beginning or the
end. This creates a "breathing" effect:

### Refactoring with AnimatedBuilder

{{site.alert.secondary}}
  <h4 class="no_toc">What's the point?</h4>

  * An [AnimatedBuilder][] understands how to render the transition.
  * An `AnimatedBuilder` doesn't know how to render the widget, nor does it
    manage the Animation object.
  * Use `AnimatedBuilder` to describe an animation as part of a build method
    for another widget. If you simply want to define a widget with a reusable
    animation, use [AnimatedWidget.](#simplifying-with-animatedwidget)
  * Examples of `AnimatedBuilders` in the Flutter API: `BottomSheet`, `ExpansionTile`,
    `PopupMenu`, `ProgressIndicator`, `RefreshIndicator`, `Scaffold`, `SnackBar`, `TabBar`,
    `TextField`.
{{site.alert.end}}

One problem with the code in the
[animate3]({{examples}}/animation/animate3/lib/main.dart) example, is that changing the
animation required changing the widget that renders the logo. A better solution
is to separate responsibilities into different classes:

* Render the logo
* Define the Animation object
* Render the transition

You can accomplish this separation with the help of the `AnimatedBuilder` class.
An `AnimatedBuilder` is a separate class in the render tree. Like `AnimatedWidget`,
`AnimatedBuilder` automatically listens to notifications from the Animation
object, and marks the widget tree dirty as necessary, so you don't need to call
`addListener()`.

The widget tree for the [animate4]({{examples}}/animation/animate4/lib/main.dart)
example looks like this:

{% asset 'ui/AnimatedBuilder-WidgetTree.png'
    alt="AnimatedBuilder widget tree" class="d-block mx-auto" width="160px" %}

Starting from the bottom of the widget tree, the code for rendering
the logo is straightforward:

<?code-excerpt "animate4/lib/main.dart (LogoWidget)"?>
```dart
class LogoWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  // Leave out the height and width so it fills the animating parent
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Container(
        margin: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 10),
        child: FlutterLogo(),
      );
}
```

The middle three blocks in the diagram are all created in the `build()` method
in `GrowTransition`, shown below. The `GrowTransition` widget itself is stateless and holds
the set of final variables necessary to define the transition animation. The
build() function creates and returns the `AnimatedBuilder`, which takes the
(`Anonymous` builder) method and the LogoWidget object as parameters. The work
of rendering the transition actually happens in the (`Anonymous` builder)
method, which creates a `Container` of the appropriate size to force the
`LogoWidget` to shrink to fit.

One tricky point in the code below is that the child looks like it's specified
twice. What's happening is that the outer reference of child is passed to
`AnimatedBuilder`, which passes it to the anonymous closure, which then uses
that object as its child. The net result is that the `AnimatedBuilder` is
inserted in between the two widgets in the render tree.

<?code-excerpt "animate4/lib/main.dart (GrowTransition)"?>
```dart
class GrowTransition extends StatelessWidget {
  GrowTransition({this.child, this.animation});

  final Widget child;
  final Animation<double> animation;

  Widget build(BuildContext context) => Center(
        child: AnimatedBuilder(
            animation: animation,
            builder: (context, child) => Container(
                  height: animation.value,
                  width: animation.value,
                  child: child,
                ),
            child: child),
      );
}
```

Finally, the code to initialize the animation looks very similar to the
[animate2]({{examples}}/animation/animate2/lib/main.dart) example. The `initState()`
method creates an `AnimationController` and a `Tween`, then binds them with
`animate()`. The magic happens in the `build()` method, which returns a
`GrowTransition` object with a `LogoWidget` as a child, and an animation object to
drive the transition. These are the three elements listed in the bullet points
above.

### Simultaneous animations

{{site.alert.secondary}}
  <h4 class="no_toc">What's the point?</h4>

  * The [Curves][] class defines an array of commonly used curves that you can
    use with a [CurvedAnimation][].
{{site.alert.end}}

In this section, you'll build on the example from [monitoring the progress of
the animation](#monitoring) ([animate3]({{examples}}/animation/animate3/lib/main.dart)),
which used `AnimatedWidget` to animate in and out continuously. Consider the case
where you want to animate in and out while the opacity animates from transparent
to opaque.

{{site.alert.note}}
  This example shows how to use multiple tweens on the same animation
  controller, where each tween manages a different effect in the animation. It
  is for illustrative purposes only. If you were tweening opacity and size in
  production code, you'd probably use [FadeTransition][] and [SizeTransition][]
  instead.
{{site.alert.end}}

Each tween manages an aspect of the animation. For example:

<?code-excerpt "animate5/lib/main.dart (tweens)" plaster="none"?>
```dart
controller =
    AnimationController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 2), vsync: this);
sizeAnimation = Tween<double>(begin: 0, end: 300).animate(controller);
opacityAnimation = Tween<double>(begin: 0.1, end: 1).animate(controller);
```

You can get the size with `sizeAnimation.value` and the opacity
with `opacityAnimation.value`, but the constructor for `AnimatedWidget`
only takes a single `Animation` object. To solve this problem,
the example creates its own `Tween` objects and explicitly calculates the
values.

Change `AnimatedLogo` to encapsulate its own `Tween` objects, and its `build()`
method calls `Tween.evaluate()` on the parent's animation object to calculate
the required size and opacity values. The following code shows the changes with
highlights:

<?code-excerpt "animate5/lib/main.dart (diff)" replace="/(static final|child: Opacity|opacity:|_sizeTween\.|CurvedAnimation).*/[!$&!]/g"?>
```dart
class AnimatedLogo extends AnimatedWidget {
  // Make the Tweens static because they don't change.
  [!static final _opacityTween = Tween<double>(begin: 0.1, end: 1);!]
  [!static final _sizeTween = Tween<double>(begin: 0, end: 300);!]

  AnimatedLogo({Key key, Animation<double> animation})
      : super(key: key, listenable: animation);

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final Animation<double> animation = listenable;
    return Center(
      [!child: Opacity(!]
        [!opacity: _opacityTween.evaluate(animation),!]
        child: Container(
          margin: EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 10),
          height: [!_sizeTween.evaluate(animation),!]
          width: [!_sizeTween.evaluate(animation),!]
          child: FlutterLogo(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class LogoApp extends StatefulWidget {
  _LogoAppState createState() => _LogoAppState();
}

class _LogoAppState extends State<LogoApp> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  Animation<double> animation;
  AnimationController controller;

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    controller =
        AnimationController(duration: const Duration(seconds: 2), vsync: this);
    animation = [!CurvedAnimation(parent: controller, curve: Curves.easeIn)!]
      ..addStatusListener((status) {
        if (status == AnimationStatus.completed) {
          controller.reverse();
        } else if (status == AnimationStatus.dismissed) {
          controller.forward();
        }
      });
    controller.forward();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => AnimatedLogo(animation: animation);

  @override
  void dispose() {
    controller.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

## Next steps

This tutorial gives you a foundation for creating animations in Flutter using
`Tweens`, but there are many other classes to explore. You might investigate the
specialized `Tween` classes, animations specific to Material Design,
`ReverseAnimation`, shared element transitions (also known as Hero animations),
physics simulations and `fling()` methods. See the [animations landing
page](/docs/development/ui/animations) for the latest available documents and
examples.
