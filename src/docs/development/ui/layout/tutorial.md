  * How Flutter's layout mechanism works.
  * How to lay out widgets vertically and horizontally.
  * How to build a Flutter layout.
{{site.alert.end}}

This is a guide to building layouts in Flutter.
You'll build the layout for the following app:

{% include app-figure.md img-class="site-mobile-screenshot border"
    image="ui/layout/lakes.jpg" caption="The finished app" %}

This guide then takes a step back to explain Flutter's approach to layout,
and shows how to place a single widget on the screen.
After a discussion of how to lay widgets out horizontally and vertically,
some of the most common layout widgets are covered.

If you want a "big picture" understanding of the layout mechanism,
start with [Flutter's approach to layout](/docs/development/ui/layout).

## Step 0: Create the app base code

Make sure you've [set up](/docs/get-started/install) your environment,
then do the following:

 1. [Create a basic "Hello World" Flutter app][hello-world].
 2. Change the app bar title and the app title as follows:

    <?code-excerpt "{codelabs/startup_namer/step1_base,layout/base}/lib/main.dart"?>
    ```diff

           home: Scaffold(

               child: Text('Hello World'),
    ```

## Step 1: Diagram the layout

The first step is to break the layout down to its basic elements:

* Identify the rows and columns.
* Does the layout include a grid?
* Are there overlapping elements?
* Does the UI need tabs?
* Notice areas that require alignment, padding, or borders.

First, identify the larger elements. In this example, four elements are
arranged into a column: an image, two rows, and a block of text.

{% include app-figure.md img-class="site-mobile-screenshot border"
    image="ui/layout/lakes-column-elts.png" caption="Column elements (circled in red)" %}

Next, diagram each row. The first row, called the Title
section, has 3 children: a column of text, a star icon,
and a number. Its first child, the column, contains 2 lines of text.
That first column takes a lot of space, so it must be wrapped in an
Expanded widget.

{% include app-figure.md image="ui/layout/title-section-parts.png" alt="Title section" %}

The second row, called the Button section, also has
3 children: each child is a column that contains an icon and text.

{% include app-figure.md image="ui/layout/button-section-diagram.png" alt="Button section" %}

Once the layout has been diagrammed, it's easiest to take a bottom-up
approach to implementing it. To minimize the visual
confusion of deeply nested layout code, place some of the implementation
in variables and functions.

## Step 2: Implement the title row

<?code-excerpt path-base="layout/lakes/step2"?>

First, you'll build the left column in the title section. Add the following code
at the top of the `build()` method of the `MyApp` class:

<?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (titleSection)" title?>
```dart
Widget titleSection = Container(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(32),
  child: Row(
    children: [
      Expanded(
        /*1*/
        child: Column(
          crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
          children: [
            /*2*/
            Container(
              padding: const EdgeInsets.only(bottom: 8),
              child: Text(
                'Oeschinen Lake Campground',
                style: TextStyle(
                  fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
                ),
              ),
            ),
            Text(
              'Kandersteg, Switzerland',
              style: TextStyle(
                color: Colors.grey[500],
              ),
            ),
          ],
        ),
      ),
      /*3*/
      Icon(
        Icons.star,
        color: Colors.red[500],
      ),
      Text('41'),
    ],
  ),
);
```

{:.numbered-code-notes}
 1. Putting a Column inside an Expanded widget stretches the column to use all
    remaining free space in the row. Setting the `crossAxisAlignment` property to
    `CrossAxisAlignment.start` positions the column at the start of the row.
 2. Putting the first row of text inside a Container enables you to add padding.
    The second child in the Column, also text, displays as grey.
 3. The last two items in the title row are a star icon, painted red,
    and the text "41". The entire row is in a Container and padded
    along each edge by 32 pixels.

Add the title section to the app body like this:

<?code-excerpt path-base="layout/lakes"?>
<?code-excerpt "{../base,step2}/lib/main.dart" from="return MaterialApp"?>

{{site.alert.tip}}
  - When pasting code into your app, indentation can
    become skewed. You can fix this in your Flutter editor
    using the [automatic reformatting support](/docs/development/tools/formatting).
  - For a faster development experience, try Flutter's [hot reload][] feature.
  - If you have problems, compare your code to [lib/main.dart][].

## Step 3: Implement the button row

<?code-excerpt path-base="layout/lakes/step3"?>

The button section contains 3 columns that use the same layout&mdash;an
icon over a row of text. The columns in this row are evenly spaced,
and the text and icons are painted with the primary color.

Since the code for building each column is almost identical, create a private
helper method named `buildButtonColumn()`, which takes a color, an Icon and
Text, and returns a column with its widgets painted in the given color.

<?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (_buildButtonColumn)" title?>
```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // ···
  }

  Column _buildButtonColumn(Color color, IconData icon, String label) {
    return Column(
      mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
      children: [
        Icon(icon, color: color),
        Container(
          margin: const EdgeInsets.only(top: 8),
          child: Text(
            label,
            style: TextStyle(
              fontSize: 12,
              fontWeight: FontWeight.w400,
              color: color,
            ),
          ),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

The function adds the icon directly to the column. The text is inside a
Container with a top-only margin, separating the text from the icon.

Build the row containing these columns by calling the function and passing the
color, `Icon`, and text specific to that column. Align the columns along the main axis
using `MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly` to arrange the free space evenly before,
between, and after each column. Add the following code just below the
`titleSection` declaration inside the `build()` method:

<?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (buttonSection)" title?>
```dart
Color color = Theme.of(context).primaryColor;

Widget buttonSection = Container(
  child: Row(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
    children: [
      _buildButtonColumn(color, Icons.call, 'CALL'),
      _buildButtonColumn(color, Icons.near_me, 'ROUTE'),
      _buildButtonColumn(color, Icons.share, 'SHARE'),
    ],
  ),
);
```

Add the button section to the body:

<?code-excerpt path-base="layout/lakes"?>
<?code-excerpt "{step2,step3}/lib/main.dart" from="return MaterialApp" to="}"?>
```diff

           ],
         ),
       ),
     );
   }
```

## Step 4: Implement the text section

<?code-excerpt path-base="layout/lakes/step4"?>

Define the text section as a variable. Put the text in a Container and add
padding along each edge. Add the following code just below the `buttonSection`
declaration:

<?code-excerpt "lib/main.dart (textSection)" title?>
```dart
Widget textSection = Container(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(32),
  child: Text(
    'Lake Oeschinen lies at the foot of the Blüemlisalp in the Bernese '
        'Alps. Situated 1,578 meters above sea level, it is one of the '
        'larger Alpine Lakes. A gondola ride from Kandersteg, followed by a '
        'half-hour walk through pastures and pine forest, leads you to the '
        'lake, which warms to 20 degrees Celsius in the summer. Activities '
        'enjoyed here include rowing, and riding the summer toboggan run.',
    softWrap: true,
  ),
);
```

By setting `softwrap` to true, text lines will fill the column width before
wrapping at a word boundary.

Add the text section to the body:

<?code-excerpt path-base="layout/lakes"?>
<?code-excerpt "{step3,step4}/lib/main.dart" from="return MaterialApp"?>
```diff

           ],
         ),
       ),

## Step 5: Implement the image section

Three of the four column elements are now complete, leaving only the image.
Add the image file to the example:

* Create an `images` directory at the top of the project.
* Add [`lake.jpg`]({{rawExFile}}/layout/lakes/step5/images/lake.jpg).

  {{site.alert.info}}
    Note that `wget` doesn't work for saving this binary file. The original image
    is [available online][] under a Creative Commons license, but it's large and
    slow to fetch.

* Update the `pubspec.yaml` file to include an `assets` tag. This makes the
  image available to your code.

`BoxFit.cover` tells the framework that the image should be as small as
possible but cover its entire render box.

## Step 6: Final touch

In this final step, arrange all of the elements in a `ListView`, rather than a
`Column`, because a `ListView` supports app body scrolling when the app is run
on a small device.
