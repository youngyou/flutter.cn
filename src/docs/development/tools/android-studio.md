## Installation and setup

Follow the [Set up an editor](/docs/get-started/editor?tab=androidstudio)
instructions to install the Dart and Flutter plugins.

### Updating the plugins<a name="updating"/>

Updates to the plugins are shipped on a regular basis. You should get
prompted in the IDE when an update is available.

To check for updates manually:

 1. Open preferences (**Android Studio > Check for Updates** on macOS,
    **Help > Check for Updates** on Linux).
 1. If `dart` or `flutter` are listed, update them.

## Creating projects

You can create a new project in one of several ways.

### Creating a new project

To create a new Flutter project from the Flutter starter app template:

 1. In the IDE, click **Create New Project** from the **Welcome** window or
    **File > New > Project** from the main IDE window.
 1. Select **Flutter** in the menu, and click **Next**.
 1. Enter your desired **Project name** and **Project location**.
 1. If you might publish this app, [set the company domain](#note).
 1. Click **Finish**.

{{site.alert.secondary}}
  <h4 id="note" class="no_toc">Setting the company domain</h4>

  When creating a new app, some Flutter IDE plugins ask for an
  organization name in reverse domain order,
  something like `com.example`. Along with the name of the app,
  this is used as the package name for Android, and the Bundle ID for iOS
  when the app is released. If you think you might ever release this app,
  it is better to specify these now. They cannot be changed once the app
  is released. Your organization name should be unique.
{{site.alert.end}}

### Creating a new project from existing source code

To create a new Flutter project containing existing Flutter source code
files:

 1. In the IDE, click **Create New Project** from the **Welcome** window or
    **File > New > Project** from the main IDE window.

    {{site.alert.important}}
      Do *not* use the **New > Project from existing sources** option for
      Flutter projects.
    {{site.alert.end}}
 1. Select **Flutter** in the menu, and click **Next**.
 1. Under **Project location** enter, or browse to, the directory holding your
    existing Flutter source code files.
 1. Click **Finish**.

## Editing code, and viewing code problems

The Dart plugin performs code analysis that enables:

* Syntax highlighting.
* Code completions based on rich type analysis.
* Navigating to type declarations (**Navigate > Declaration**),
  and finding type usages (**Edit > Find > Find Usages**).
* Viewing all current source code problems
  (**View > Tool Windows > Dart Analysis**).
  Any analysis issues are shown in the Dart Analysis pane:<br>
  ![Dart Analysis pane]({% asset tools/android-studio/dart-analysis.png @path %})

## Running and debugging

Running and debugging are controlled from the main toolbar:

![Main IntelliJ toolbar]({% asset tools/android-studio/main-toolbar.png @path %})

### Selecting a target

When a Flutter project is open in the IDE, you should see a set of Flutter
specific buttons on the right-hand side of the toolbar.

{{site.alert.note}}
  If the Run and Debug buttons are disabled, and no targets are listed,
  Flutter has not been able to discover any connected iOS or Android devices or
  simulators.  You need to connect a device, or start a simulator, to proceed.
{{site.alert.end}}

 1. Locate the **Flutter Target Selector** drop-down button. This shows a
    list of available targets.
 2. Select the target you want your app to be started on.
    When you connect devices, or start simulators, additional entries appear.

### Run app without breakpoints

 1. Click the **Play icon** in the toolbar, or invoke **Run > Run**.
    The bottom **Run** pane shows logs output:<br>

    ![Log pane]({% asset tools/android-studio/log.png @path %})

### Run app with breakpoints

 1. If desired, set breakpoints in your source code.
 1. Click the **Debug icon** in the toolbar, or invoke **Run > Debug**.
    * The bottom **Debugger** pane shows Stack Frames and Variables.
    * The bottom **Console** pane shows detailed logs output.
    * Debugging is based on a default launch configuration. To customize this,
      click the drop-down button to the right of the device selector, and select
      **Edit configuration**.

## Fast edit and refresh development cycle

Flutter offers a best-in-class developer cycle enabling you to see the effect
of your changes almost instantly with the _hot reload_ feature. See
[Using hot reload](hot-reload) for details.

## Advanced debugging

### Debugging visual layout issues

To debug a visual issue, run the app in **Debug** mode,
and then open the Flutter inspector tool window using
**View > Tool Windows > Flutter Inspector**.

![Flutter Inspector Window]({% asset tools/android-studio/visual-debugging.png @path %})

This offers many debugging tools; for details on these see
[Debugging Flutter apps][].

* **Enable select widget mode**: Select a widget on the device to inspect
  in the [Flutter Inspector](/docs/development/tools/inspector).
* **Refresh widget info**: Reload the current widget info.
* **Show/hide performance overlay**: Toggle display of performance graphs
  for the GPU & CPU threads.
* **Toggle platform mode**: Toggle between rendering for Android or iOS.
* **Show debug paint**: Add visual debugging hints to the rendering
  displaying borders, padding, alignment, and spacers.
* **Show paint baselines**: Cause each RenderBox to paint a line at each
  of its text baselines.
* **Enable slow animations**: Slow down animations to enable visual
  inspection.

Also available in the "more actions" menu:

* **Show Repaint Rainbow**: Shows rotating colors on layers when repainting.
* **Hide Debug Mode Banner**: Hides the debug banner even when running a
  debug build.
* **Highlight nodes displayed in both trees**: In the inspector, highlights
  nodes shown in both the details and summary trees.

### Show performance data

To view the performance data, including the widget rebuild information,
start the app in **Debug** mode, and then open the Performance tool window
using **View > Tool Windows > Flutter Performance**.

![Flutter performance window]({% asset tools/android-studio/widget-rebuild-info.png @path %})

To see the stats about which widgets are being rebuilt, and how often,
click **Show widget rebuild information** in the **Performance** pane.
The exact count of the rebuilds for this frame displays in the second
column from the right. For a high number of rebuilds, a yellow spinning
circle displays. The column to the far right shows how many times a
widget was rebuilt since entering the current screen.
For widgets that aren't rebuilt, a solid grey circle displays.
Otherwise, a grey spinning circle displays.

{{site.alert.secondary}}
  The app shown in this screenshot has been designed to deliver
  poor performance, and the rebuild profiler gives you a clue
  about what is happening in the frame that might cause poor
  performance. The widget rebuild profiler is not a diagnostic
  tool, by itself, about poor performance.
{{site.alert.end}}

The purpose of this feature is to make you aware when widgets are
rebuilding&mdash;you might not realize that this is happening when just
looking at the code. If widgets are rebuilding that you didn't expect,
it's probably a sign that you should refactor your code by splitting
up large build methods into multiple widgets.

This tool can help you debug at least four common performance issues:

1. The whole screen (or large pieces of it) are built by a single
   StatefulWidget, causing unnecessary UI building. Split up the
   UI into smaller widgets with smaller `build()` functions.

1. Offscreen widgets are being rebuilt. This can happen, for example,
   when a ListView is nested in a tall Column that extends offscreen.
   Or when the RepaintBoundary is not set for a list that extends
   offscreen, causing the whole list to be redrawn.

1. The `build()` function for an AnimatedBuilder draws a subtree that
   does not need to be animated, causing unnecessary rebuilds of static
   objects.

1. An Opacity widget is placed unnecessarily high in the widget tree.
   Or, an Opacity animation is created by directly manipulating the
   opacity property of the Opacity widget, causing the widget itself
   and its subtree to rebuild.

You can click on a line in the table to navigate to the line
in the source where the widget is created. As the code runs,
the spinning icons also display in the code pane to help you
visualize which rebuilds are happening.

Note that numerous rebuilds doesn't necessarily indicate a problem.
Typically you should only worry about excessive rebuilds if you have 
already run the app in profile mode and verified that the performance
is not what you want.

And remember, _the widget rebuild information is only available in
a debug build_. Test the app's performance on a real device in a profile
build, but debug performance issues in a debug build.

### Debugging with Dart DevTools

Dart DevTools are a set of debugging and profiling tools presented with
an html-based UI. DevTools replaces the previous browser-based profiling
tool, Observatory.

DevTools is still in development but is available to preview. For
installation and getting started instructions, see the [DevTools' docs][].

## Editing tips for Flutter code

If you have additional tips we should share, please [let us know][]!

### Assists & Quick Fixes

Assists are code changes related to a certain code identifier. A number of these
are available when the cursor is placed on a Flutter widget identifier, as
indicated by the yellow lightbulb icon. The assist can be invoked by clicking
the lightbulb, or by using the keyboard shortcut
(`Alt`+`Enter` on Linux and Windows, `Option`+`Return` on macOS),
as illustrated here:

![IntelliJ editing assists]({% asset tools/android-studio/assists.gif @path %})

Quick Fixes are similar, only they are shown with a piece of code has an error
and they can assist in correcting it. They are indicated with a red lightbulb.

#### Wrap with new widget assist

This can be used when you have a widget that you want to wrap in a surrounding
widget, for example if you want to wrap a widget in a `Row` or `Column`.

####  Wrap widget list with new widget assist

Similar to the assist above, but for wrapping an existing list of widgets rather
than an individual widget.

#### Convert child to children assist

Changes a child argument to a children argument,
and wraps the argument value in a list.

### Live templates

Live templates can be used to speed up entering typical code structures.
They are invoked by typing their prefix, and then selecting it in the code
completion window:

![IntelliJ live templates]({% asset tools/android-studio/templates.gif @path %})

The Flutter plugin includes the following templates:

* Prefix `stless`: Create a new subclass of `StatelessWidget`.
* Prefix `stful`: Create a new subclass of `StatefulWidget` and
  its associated State subclass.
* Prefix `stanim`: Create a new subclass of `StatefulWidget` and its
  associated State subclass, including a field initialized with an
  `AnimationController`.

You can also define custom templates in **Settings > Editor > Live Templates**.

### Keyboard shortcuts

**Hot reload**

On Linux (keymap _Default for XWin_) and Windows the keyboard shortcuts
are `Controle`+`Alt`+`;` and `Control`+`Backslash`.

On macOS (keymap _Mac OS X 10.5+ copy_) the keyboard shortcuts are
`Command`+`Option` and `Command`+`Backslash`.

Keyboard mappings can be changed in the IDE Preferences/Settings: Select
*Keymap*, then enter _flutter_ into the search box in the upper right corner.
Right click the binding you want to change and _Add Keyboard Shortcut_.

![IntelliJ settings keymap]({% asset tools/android-studio/keymap-settings-flutter-plugin.png @path %})

### Hot reload vs. Full app restart

Hot Reload works by injecting updated source code files into the running Dart VM
(Virtual Machine). This includes not only adding new classes, but also adding
methods and fields to existing classes, and changing existing functions.
A few types of code changes cannot be hot reloaded though:

* Global variable initializers
* Static field initializers
* The `main()` method of the app

For these changes you can fully restart your application,
without having to end your debugging session:

1. Don't click the Stop button; simply re-click the Run button (if in a run
session) or Debug button (if in a debug session), or shift-click the 'hot
reload' button.

## Editing Android code in Android Studio with full IDE support {#android-ide}

Opening the root directory of a Flutter project doesn't expose all the Android
files to the IDE. Flutter apps contain a subdirectory named `android`. If you
open this subdirectory as its own separate project in Android Studio, the IDE
will be able to fully support editing and refactoring all Android files (like
Gradle scripts).

If you already have the entire project opened as a Flutter app in Android
Studio, there are two equivalent ways to open the Android files on their own
for editing in the IDE. Before trying this, make sure that you're on the latest
version of Android Studio and the Flutter plugins.

* In the ["project view"][], you should see a subdirectory immediately under
  the root of your flutter app named `android`. Right click on it,
  then select **Flutter > Open Android module in Android Studio**.
* OR, you can open any of the files under the `android` subdirectory for
  editing. You should then see a "Flutter commands" banner at the top of the
  editor with a link  labeled **Open for Editing in Android Studio**.
  Click that link.

For both options, Android Studio gives you the option to use separate windows or
to replace the existing window with the new project when opening a second
project. Either option is fine.

If you don't already have the Flutter project opened in Android studio,
you can open the Android files as their own project from the start:

1. Click **Open an existing Android Studio Project** on the Welcome splash screen,
   or **File > Open** if Android Studio is already open.
2. Open the `android` subdirectory immediately under the flutter app root. For
   example if the project is called `flutter_app`, open `flutter_app/android`.

If you haven't run your Flutter app yet, you may see Android Studio report a
build error when you open the `android` project. Run `flutter packages get` in
the app's root directory and rebuild the project by selecting **Build > Make**
to fix it.

## Editing Android code in IntelliJ IDEA {#edit-android-code}

To enable editing of Android code in IntelliJ IDEA, you need to configure the
location of the Android SDK:

 1. In **Preferences > Plugins**, enable **Android Support** if you
    haven't already.
 1. Right-click the **android** folder in the Project view, and select **Open
    Module Settings**.
 1. In the **Sources** tab, locate the **Language level** field, and
    select level 8 or later.
 1. In the **Dependencies** tab, locate the **Module SDK** field, and select an
    Android SDK. If no SDK is listed, click **New** and specify the location of
    the Android SDK. Make sure to select an Android SDK matching the one used by
    Flutter (as reported by `flutter doctor`).
 1. Click **OK**.
