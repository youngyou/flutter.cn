Apps often require users to enter information into a text field. For
example, we might be working on an app that requires our users to log in with an
email address and password combination.

In order to make our apps secure and easy to use, we can check whether the
information the user has provided is valid. If the user has correctly filled
out the form, we can process the information. If the user submits incorrect
information, we can display a friendly error message letting them know what went
wrong.

In this example, we'll see how to add validation to a form with a single
text field.

## Directions

  1. Create a `Form` with a `GlobalKey`
  2. Add a `TextFormField` with validation logic
  3. Create a button to validate and submit the form

## 1. Create a `Form` with a `GlobalKey`

First, we'll need a [`Form`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Form-class.html)
to work with. The `Form` Widget acts as a container to group and validate
multiple form fields.

When we create the form, we'll also need to provide a
[`GlobalKey`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/GlobalKey-class.html).
This will uniquely identify the `Form` that we're working with, and will allow
us to validate the form in a later step.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
// Define a Custom Form Widget
class MyCustomForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  MyCustomFormState createState() {
    return MyCustomFormState();
  }
}

// Define a corresponding State class. This class will hold the data related to
// the form.
class MyCustomFormState extends State<MyCustomForm> {
  // Create a global key that will uniquely identify the Form widget and allow
  // us to validate the form
  //
  // Note: This is a `GlobalKey<FormState>`, not a GlobalKey<MyCustomFormState>!
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build a Form widget using the _formKey we created above
    return Form(
      key: _formKey,
      child: // We'll build this out in the next steps!
    );
  }
}
```

{{site.alert.tip}}
Using a `GlobalKey` is the recommended way to access a form. However, if you
have a more complex widget tree, you can use the
[`Form.of`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/Form/of.html) method to
access the form within nested widgets.
{{site.alert.end}}

## 2. Add a `TextFormField` with validation logic

We have our `Form` in place, but we haven't provided a way for our users to
enter text! This is the job of a
[`TextFormField`]({{site.api}}/flutter/material/TextFormField-class.html).
The `TextFormField` Widget renders a material design text input and knows how to
display validation errors when they occur.

How can we validate the input? By providing a `validator` function to the
`TextFormField`. If there is an error with the information the user has
provided, the `validator` function must return a `String` containing
an error message. If there are no errors, the function should not return
anything.

In this example, we will create a `validator` that ensures the `TextFormField`
isn't empty. If it is empty, we will return a friendly error message!

<!-- skip -->
```dart
TextFormField(
  // The validator receives the text the user has typed in
  validator: (value) {
    if (value.isEmpty) {
      return 'Please enter some text';
    }
  },
);
```

## 3. Create a button to validate and submit the form

Now that we have a form with a text field, we'll need to provide a button the
user can tap to submit the information.

When the user attempts to submit the form, we'll need to check if the form is
valid. If it is, we will show a success message. If the text field has no
content, we'll want to display the error message.

<!-- skip -->
```dart
RaisedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // Validate will return true if the form is valid, or false if
    // the form is invalid.
    if (_formKey.currentState.validate()) {
      // If the form is valid, display a snackbar. In the real world, you'd
      // often want to call a server or save the information in a database
      Scaffold
          .of(context)
          .showSnackBar(SnackBar(content: Text('Processing Data')));
    }
  },
  child: Text('Submit'),
);
```

### How does this work?

In order to validate the form, we'll need to use the `_formKey` created in
step 1. We can use the `_formKey.currentState` method to access the
[`FormState`]({{site.api}}/flutter/widgets/FormState-class.html),
which is automatically created by Flutter when we build a `Form`.

The `FormState` class contains the `validate` method. When the `validate` method
is called, it will run the `validator` function for each text field in the form.
If everything looks good, the method returns `true`. If any text field contains
errors, it will display the error message for each invalid text field and return
`false`.

## Complete example

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final appTitle = 'Form Validation Demo';

    return MaterialApp(
      title: appTitle,
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text(appTitle),
        ),
        body: MyCustomForm(),
      ),
    );
  }
}

// Create a Form Widget
class MyCustomForm extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  MyCustomFormState createState() {
    return MyCustomFormState();
  }
}

// Create a corresponding State class. This class will hold the data related to
// the form.
class MyCustomFormState extends State<MyCustomForm> {
  // Create a global key that will uniquely identify the Form widget and allow
  // us to validate the form
  //
  // Note: This is a GlobalKey<FormState>, not a GlobalKey<MyCustomFormState>!
  final _formKey = GlobalKey<FormState>();

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Build a Form widget using the _formKey we created above
    return Form(
      key: _formKey,
      child: Column(
        crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.start,
        children: <Widget>[
          TextFormField(
            validator: (value) {
              if (value.isEmpty) {
                return 'Please enter some text';
              }
            },
          ),
          Padding(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 16.0),
            child: RaisedButton(
              onPressed: () {
                // Validate will return true if the form is valid, or false if
                // the form is invalid.
                if (_formKey.currentState.validate()) {
                  // If the form is valid, we want to show a Snackbar
                  Scaffold.of(context)
                      .showSnackBar(SnackBar(content: Text('Processing Data')));
                }
              },
              child: Text('Submit'),
            ),
          ),
        ],
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
