New to the [Dart]({{site.dart-site}}) language?
We compiled our favorite resources to
help you quickly learn Dart.
We looked at a lot of languages, and [we found Dart easy
and fun to learn](/docs/resources/faq#why-did-flutter-choose-to-use-dart).
We hope these resources make Dart easy for you to learn, too.

[Language tour]({{site.dart-site}}/guides/language/language-tour)
: Your best introduction to the Dart language. Learn about Dart's
  features such as _strong types_, _closures_, _libraries_, _lexical scoping_,
  _top-level functions_, _named parameters_, _async / await_, and lots more.

[Library tour]({{site.dart-site}}/guides/libraries/library-tour)
: A good overview of Dart's powerful core libraries. Learn about
  Dart's support for collections, async, math, numbers, strings, JSON, and more.

[Intro to Dart for Java Developers Codelab]({{site.codelabs}}/codelabs/from-java-to-dart)
: Use your Java knowledge to get up and running quickly with Dart. Learn about
  classes, constructors, parameters, and interfaces with examples from the Java
  Tutorial.

[Effective Dart]({{site.dart-site}}/guides/language/effective-dart)
: Guides for style, authoring documentation, usage, and more.

[Asynchronous Programming: Futures Tutorial]({{site.dart-site}}/tutorials/language/futures)
: Learn how to use Futures, which are used extensively in the Dart core
  libraries.  Futures can be used instead of one-time callbacks.

[Asynchronous Programming: Streams Tutorial]({{site.dart-site}}/docs/tutorials/streams)
: Learn how to use Streams, which are used extensively in the Dart core
  libraries. Streams can be used instead repeating callbacks.
  For example, the
  [File class]({{site.api}}/flutter/dart-io/File-class.html)
  uses Streams to read bytes from a file.
