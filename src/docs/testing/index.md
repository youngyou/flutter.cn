The more features your app has, the harder it is to test manually. Automated
tests help ensure that your app performs correctly before you publish it, while
retaining your feature and bug fix velocity.

Automated testing falls into a few categories:

- A [_unit test_](#unit-tests) tests a single function, method, or class. 
- A [_widget test_](#widget-tests) (in other UI frameworks referred to as _component test_) tests
  a single widget. 
- An [_integration test_](#integration-tests)
  tests a complete app or a large part of an app.
  
Generally speaking, a well-tested app has many unit and widget tests, tracked by
[code coverage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage), plus enough
integration tests to cover all the important use cases. This advice is based on
the fact that there are trade-offs between different kinds of testing, seen
below.

|                      | Unit   | Widget | Integration |
|----------------------|--------|--------|-------------|
|                      | 单元测试   | 部件测试 | 集成测试 |
| **Confidence**       | Low    | Higher | Highest     |
| **置信度**       | 低    | 高 | 最高     |
| **Maintenance cost** | Low    | Higher | Highest     |
| **Dependencies**     | Few    | More   | Most        |
| **Execution speed**  | Quick  | Slower | Slowest     |

## Unit tests

A _unit test_ tests a single function, method, or class. The goal of a unit test
is to verify the correctness of a unit of logic under a variety of conditions.
External dependencies of the unit under test are generally [mocked
out](/cookbook/testing/mocking). Unit tests generally don't read from or write
to disk, render to screen, or receive user actions from outside the process
running the test.

## Widget tests

A _widget test_ (in other UI frameworks referred to as _component test_) tests a
single widget. The goal of a widget test is to verify that the widget's UI looks
and interacts as expected. Testing a widget involves multiple classes and
requires a test environment that provides the appropriate widget lifecycle
context. 

For example, the Widget being tested should be able to receive and 
respond to user actions and events, perform layout, and instantiate child 
widgets. A widget test is therefore more comprehensive than a unit test. However, like a
unit test, a widget test's environment is replaced with an implementation much
simpler than a full-blown UI system.

{% include testing_toc.md type='widget' %} 

## Integration tests

An _integration test_ tests a complete app or a large part of an app. The goal
of an integration test is to verify that all the widgets and services being
tested work together other as expected. Furthermore, you can use integration
tests to verify your app's performance.

Generally, an _integration test_ runs on a real device or an OS emulator, such
as iOS Simulator or Android Emulator. The app under test is typically isolated
from the test driver code to avoid skewing the results.

## Continuous integration services

Continuous integration (CI) services allow you to run your tests automatically
when pushing new code changes. This provides timely feedback on whether the code
changes work as expected and do not introduce bugs.

For information on running tests on various continuous integration services,
please see the following: 

* [Continuous Delivery using fastlane with
  Flutter](/docs/deployment/fastlane-cd/)
* [Test Flutter apps on
  Travis]({{site.flutter-medium}}/test-flutter-apps-on-travis-3fd5142ecd8c)
* [GitLab Continuous Integration
  (GitLab CI/CD)](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/README.html#doc-nav).
  You'll need to create and configure a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file. You can 
  [find an example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianegan/flutter_redux/master/.gitlab-ci.yml)
  in the [flutter_redux library]({{site.github}}/brianegan/flutter_redux).
